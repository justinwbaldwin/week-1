# S2023 - Intro to Julia - Week 1
I am making my first local respository in VS Code. This seems very similar to R Studio repositories.
I am writing this in the code editor Visual Studio Code in Markdown.


### NOW I ADDED A LINE TO THE README FILE ON GITHUB VIA THE WEB BROWSER


I pulled those changes from the repositoy on GitHub and now am adding this final line in VS Code and then will commit and push these changes and send the repo URL to the instructor.

Looks like the first step was to "publish branch", then I should be able to just "push"
